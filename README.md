Exercises I completed during my GenAI course by Udacity

1:- **Classification of Handwritten Digits Using an MLP **: In this exercise, I trained a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). The task is to classify each image into one of the 10 classes (one for each digit).
